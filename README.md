# DeepBranchTracer: A Generally-Applicable Approach to Curvilinear Structure Reconstruction Using Multi-Feature Learning

DeepBranchTracer is a novel method for reconstructing curvilinear structures from 2D and 3D images. It leverages deep learning to extract both image and geometric features, enabling accurate and continuous reconstruction of line-like objects, such as roads, vessels, and neurons.
