# DeepBranchTracer: A Generally-Applicable Approach to Curvilinear Structure Reconstruction Using Multi-Feature Learning

DeepBranchTracer is a novel method for reconstructing curvilinear structures from 2D and 3D images. It leverages deep learning to extract both image and geometric features, enabling accurate and continuous reconstruction of line-like objects, such as roads, vessels, and neurons.



# Usage

It is recommended to use **neutube** software to visualize images and SWC files. **neutube** can be downloaded from https://neutracing.com/.
